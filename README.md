These are my config file(s).

If you wanna test/use my Vim config, including all the plugins I use, all you have to do is:

1. a. Backup your Vim config if you have one

   b. Get a fresh install of Vim, as in a default .vim/vimfiles folder

2. Install NeoBundle (https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

3. a. Remove your vimrc, wherever it is (unix: ~/.vimrc; windows: $VIM/_vimrc OR ~/_vimrc)

   b. Copy my vimrc to that same place, with the correct name

4. Open vim and it should prompt you to auto-install all the plugins

5. GO FOR IT!! (done)
