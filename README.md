# ðŸ“œ README

These are my dotfiles. Check out my
[vimconfig](https://github.com/auwsmit/dotfiles/blob/master/vimconfig/) and
[vimrc](https://github.com/auwsmit/dotfiles/blob/master/vimconfig/vimrc).
They're setup to work for both original Vim and Neovim, and are easily the most
customized and regularly updated parts of my dotfiles. I try to keep most of it
well commented.

If you want to try out my setup or just part of it, read the relevant Setup
script, modify it to only link files you want, and then run it. Any already
existing config files will be moved into a backup folder as noted in the setup
script.

Regarding vim, if  something isn't commented, it means you can probably `:help`
that thing to figure out what it does. Vim has great built-in documentation,
especially if you [know how to use
it](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/novice/#Help).
