# üìú README

These are my dotfiles. Primarily made by stealing good ideas and snippets
from other people. I try to keep things decently commented and organized.

My vim config currently has the most time and effort put into it. [My Emacs
config](https://github.com/auwsmit/emacsconfig) is similar, but so large with
all its packages included that it's kept in a separate repository.

Regarding vim, if  something isn't commented, it means you can probably `:help`
that thing to figure out what it does. Vim has great built-in documentation,
especially if you [know how to use
it](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/novice/#Help).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is all catered to me. Copy whatever you want out of it, but I would advise
against installing the whole thing unless you know what you're doing. It's
better to make your own from scratch. If you do copy something, be sure to know
what it does.
