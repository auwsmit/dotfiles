These are my config file(s).

If you wanna test/use my Vim config, including all the plugins I use, all you have to do is: 
1. Get a fresh install of Vim, as in a default .vim/vimfiles folder
2. Install NeoBundle (https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
3. 3a. Remove your vimrc, wherever it is (unix: ~/.vimrc; windows: $VIM\_vimrc OR ~\_vimrc)
   3b. Copy my vimrc to that same place, with the correct name
4. Open vim and it should prompt you to auto-install all the plugins
5. GO FOR IT!! (done)
